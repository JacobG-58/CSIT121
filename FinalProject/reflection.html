    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

    <p>This project allowed me to bring together all the skills I learned this semester.
      I have faced many challenges throughout my web development journey that have taught me what to do differently each time.
      One difficulty of this lab was making sure all pages were different but fit the same vibe/ design.
      Another challenge was creating the table with all of my projects, since it took a while to put everything on it.</p>

    <p>Testing my website on multiple browsers showed me once again that small layout differences can appear between them. Viewing the site on my phone also made me realize how important accessibilty is, especially in regards to simple navigation and readable fonts.</p>

    <p>Throughout this course, I learned how HTML, CSS, and many other languages work together to build functional websites.
      I also have gained experience structuring pages, adding images, working with links, creating layouts that adjust to different screens and much more.
      It's crazy to see how much i've learned and progressed since lab 1.
      I hope to keep getting better at web development in the future.</p>
