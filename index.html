        <p>The process of learning what HTML is and how to apply what 
           I've learned to create my own webpages has been an enjoyable experience.
           After going through the learning material and doing a bit of research, I
           had a decent idea of how to approach utilizing HTML to build a webpage.
           While my knowledge of the HTML syntax is still on a basic level of 
           comprehension, I think my limited experience with programming
           languages has helped in the memorization aspect of basic tags and 
           structures. If I was having trouble remembering information, I would reference
           the <strong>Element Reference Website</strong> that was provided in the learning material.
        </p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Tags are declared by the bracket symbols surrounding them.</li>
            <li>The format for a basic HTML page includes: <br><b>(Doctype Declaration</b>, <b>Head</b>, <b>Title</b>,
            <b>Body</b>, <b>Headers</b>, <b>Paragraphs</b>, and <b>Closures Of All Tags Listed.)</b></li>
            <li>To close a tag, you must add a forward slash (/) before its signifying letters.<br> Example: <i>"head" closes with "/head"</i></li>
        </ol>

        <p>I have spent some time learning about the basics of CSS and how it can be effectively used to
           alter the styling of a web page, thus giving the user a more enjoyable experience. Similarly to HTML, the syntax
           is composed of elements that are used to assign various styling options to different assets.
           CSS elements have been easier to remember for me because their names are more descriptive and the parameters within each
           element are fairly straightforward. However, it can become tricky when determining what elements
           should be assigned to which text, and can get overwhelming if you want a higher level of stylish diversity. This is where
           selectors come in; id and class selectors make a world of difference when trying to diversify style in your webpage 
           because they allow you to set styling rules that can be applied specifically to certain parts of your HTML file.
        </p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Class selectors must come after a "." and id selectors must come after a "#".</li>
            <li>A style sheet is a file referenced directly by an HTML file, containing rules and parameters that define
                the styling choices for a web page.</li>
            <li>When creating borders, it is often a good idea to follow them up with padding style changes
                to ensure the content within the borders is not cramped and messy looking.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In this lab, I focused on responsive design using Flexbox and media querie. focused on how to create layouts that 
            adapt to different screen sizes (desktop/ phone) while keeping everything easy to read. This lab also put strong emphasis on accessibility by ensuring a clean layout, consistent typography, and balanced color choices 
           make a page easier to read and navigate. To achieve this level of accessibility it is also important to have a functional navigation pane. This allows users to efficiently navigate to parts of the website they may not originally see if on certain devices.
