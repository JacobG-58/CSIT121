<h1>Website Evaluation: ASPCA.org</h1>

    <h2>Screenshot of Website</h2>

    <h2>1. What is the URL of the website?</h2>
        <p>The official website of the ASPCA is 
            <a href="https://www.aspca.org">https://www.aspca.org</a>.
        </p>


    <h2>2. What is the name of the website?</h2>
        <p>The website is the <strong>American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)</strong>.</p>


    <h2>3. Who is the site's target audience?</h2>
        <p>The target audience includes animal lovers, pet owners, potential donaters, and volunteers who want to support animals and prevent cruelty. </p>


    <h2>4. How is the site organized?</h2>
        <p>The ASPCA website is organized using a top navigation bar with different sections like “Adopt,” “Donate,” “Our Work,” “About Us" etc. Content is structured with precision and efficiency in mind, allowing users to move from broad information to specific topics (for example, from “Adopt” to “Find a Shelter Near You”). Consistent layout and navigation support exploration of the site.</p>


    <h2>5. Which CRAP Design Principles does it use? Provide at least one example.</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Fonts, colors, and button styles are consistent throughout the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements follow a clean structure that keeps text, images, navigation, and other content aligned for easy reading/ accessibility.</li>
    </ul>    


    <h2>6. What is the Audit Score according to the Accessibility Checker?</h2>
        <p>The ASPCA.org site surprisingly received an Accessibility score of 41%. I thought the html looked pretty proffesional but the audit scan revealed some structuring issues and some flaws that could negatively impact the experience of users with certain disablitlies like low vision or colorblindness.</p>


    <h2>7. What is the site's effectiveness?</h2>
        <p>The site is highly effective at establishing what its for and getting the viewer invested in the content. Theres tons of pictures and resources that incite the user to feel empathetic towards the aninals and therefore want to donate.</p>


    <h2>8. What is the site's efficiency?</h2>
        <p>Users can navigate efficiently because of the consistent design. Pages seem to load quickly, and common tasks are easy to find and access.</p>


    <h2>9. How is the engagement?</h2>
        <p>The website is both visually and emotionally engaging. There are many cute photos of animals, success stories, and an empathetic tones that connect with the user on an emotional level. The sites also looks very professional which is imperative for user engagement.</p>


    <h2>10. Recommendation for Improvement</h2>
        <p>To further enhance accessibility and usability, the ASPCA could possibly improve color contrast to narrow down on important aspects and ensure every decorative image includes meaningful text to go with it..</p>
