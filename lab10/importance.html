    <h2>Why InkML Is Important</h2>

    <p>InkML is important because it provides a universal way to store and share digital ink data across different devices and software. 
    Without a shared standard, stylus information from one system might not work properly on another. 
    InkML eliminates this compatibility problem by giving developers a common language for representing ink strokes. 
    This consistency is valuable in environments where multiple devices or applications need to exchange handwriting or drawing information. 
    As a result, InkML helps create smoother, more reliable workflows for digital note-taking and sketching.</p>
    
    <p>Another reason InkML is important is its ability to store high-quality and highly detailed data. 
    Many applications rely on pen pressure, stroke speed, and tilt information to interpret handwriting accurately. 
    InkML supports all of these details, making it practical for tools that convert handwriting to text or analyze the way a signature was written. 
    This level of detail also helps maintain the natural look and feel of handwritten content when it is displayed or replayed. 
    Because InkML preserves more than just the final image, it improves both accuracy and realism.</p>
    
    <p>InkML also plays a key role in multimodal interaction, where users combine handwriting with speech, gesture, or touch. 
    The standard was designed to fit into systems that handle several different input methods at once. 
    This makes it especially useful in educational tools, creative applications, and accessibility technologies. 
    As tablets and 2-in-1 laptops become more popular, stylus input is becoming an expected feature rather than a specialty tool. 
    InkML supports this trend by ensuring that pen-based interactions can be integrated effectively into modern user interfaces.</p>
