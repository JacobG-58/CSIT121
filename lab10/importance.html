<h2>Why InkML Is Important</h2>

    <p>InkML is important because it provides a way to store and share digital ink data across different devices and software. 
    Without a shared standard, stylus information from one system might not work as imtended on another. 
    InkML eliminates this compatibility problem by giving developers a common language for showing strokes. 
    This consistency is valuable where multiple devices or applications need to exchange handwriting or drawing info. 
    InkML helps create smoother, more reliable digital note taking and sketching.</p>
    
    <p>Another reason InkML is important is its ability to store quality and detailed data. 
    Many applications rely on pressure, speed, and tilt information to interpret handwriting accurately. 
    InkML supports all of these details, making it good for tools that convert handwriting to text or analyze the way a signature was written. 
    This level of detail also helps maintain the natural look and feel of handwritten content when its displayed. 
    Because InkML preserves more than just the final image, it improves both accuracy and realisticness.</p>
    
    <p>InkML also plays a big role in interactions where users combine handwriting with speech, or touch. 
    The standard was designed to fit into systems that handle sevral different input methods at once. 
    This makes it especially useful in education, creative applications, and accessibility tech. 
    As tablets and 2 in 1 laptops become more popular, stylus inputs is becoming an expected feature rather than a specialty. 
    InkML supports this trend by ensuring that pen based interactions can be integrated effectively into modern user interfaces.</p>
