    <h2>What Is InkML?</h2>

    <p>InkML, or Ink Markup Language, is a W3C standard created to represent digital ink data.
    It provides a structured way to record the movements of a stylus, pen, or finger as they draw or write on a digital surface.
    Instead of storing ink as a simple image, InkML saves the underlying stroke information, including the exact points that make up the handwriting or drawing.
    This allows software to understand the ink in a much deeper way. 
    Because of this design, InkML makes it possible to work with handwriting and sketches in a flexible and reusable format.</p>
    
    <p>What makes InkML unique is the type of information it can capture about each stroke. 
    It doesn’t just store x- and y-coordinates, but can also include pressure, speed, tilt, and timestamps recorded during writing. 
    This provides a far more detailed representation than a normal picture or basic vector graphic. 
    Applications can use this extra detail for handwriting recognition, signature verification, and replaying strokes exactly as they occurred. 
    By capturing how the ink was created, InkML allows developers to build smarter pen-based tools.</p>
    
    <p>InkML was developed by the W3C’s Multimodal Interaction Working Group and became an official W3C Recommendation in September 2011. 
    The standard was created as digital pens and tablets were becoming increasingly common, making a consistent ink format more important. 
    The W3C recognized that companies were using incompatible methods for storing pen input, which made sharing and processing ink data difficult. 
    InkML was designed to solve that problem by offering a universal, open format. 
    Today, it remains a foundation for many technologies that rely on handwriting or stylus-based interaction.</p>
