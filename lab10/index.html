<h2>What Is InkML?</h2>

    <p>InkML is a W3C standard made to represent digital ink.
    It provides a way to record movements of a stylus, pen, or finger as they draw on digital surface.
    Instead of storing ink as a image, InkML saves the stroke info, with the exact points that make up the handwriting or drawing.
    This allows software to sort of understand the ink in a way. 
    Because of this, InkML makes it possible to work with handwriting and sketches in a flexible format.</p>
    
    <p>What makes InkML special is the type of information it can capture about each strokes. 
    It doesnt just store x and y coordinates, but can also include pressure, speed, tilt, and times recorded during writing/ drawing. 
    This provides a far more detailed representation than a normal picture. 
    Applications can use this detail for handwriting recognition, signature verification, and replaying strokes exactly as they occurred (similar to how a keylogger records the keys pressed). 
    By capturing how the ink was created, InkML allows developers to build smarter pen-based tools.</p>
    
    <p>InkML was developed by the W3Cs Multimodal Interaction Working Group and became an official W3C Recommendation in September 2011. 
    The standard was created as digital pens were becoming increasingly common, making an ink format more important. 
    The W3C recognized that companies were using incompatible methods for storing pen input, which made sharing and processing ink data difficult. 
    InkML was designed to solve that problem by offering a universal, public/ open format. 
    Today, it remains a foundation for many technologies that rely on handwriting or stylus based formatting.</p>
