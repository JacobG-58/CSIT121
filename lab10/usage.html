<h2>How InkML Is Used</h2>

    <p>InkML is widely used in digital handwriting applications that rely on the stylus's input. 
    Note taking programs, sketching apps, etc. use InkML to store and process user generated strokes. 
    By capturing detailed stroke data, these applications can replay handwriting, adjust its appearance, or convert it to text. 
    InkML makes it easier for software to process or understand the users writing style, which can improve accuracy in the recognition of handwriting. 
    For creative tools, it also helps keep the natural motion and feel of drawing.</p>
    
    <p>The standard is also frequently used in electronic signature systems. 
    Banks, delivery companies, and legal services need to rely on more than just the appearance of a signature. they also examine the way it was written. 
    InkMLs ability to store pressure and timing data makes signatures more secure in this context because it captures characteristics that are difficult to forge. 
    This gives a higher level of confidence when taking digital signatures. 
    By analyzing the motion behind the signature, not just the shape, InkML enhances digital security.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to consumer applications, InkML is valuable in technical and academic environments. 
    Education tools may use InkML to capture handwritten math equations, diagrams, or annotations made during lessons. 
    Researchers studying handwriting recognition also use InkML data to test algorithms. 
    Design and modeling software can use InkML to capture precise stylus movements for more natural drawings. 
    Across all of the fields, InkML provides the detailed and structured ink data needed to support more advanced digital writing systems.</p>
