    <h2>How InkML Is Used</h2>

    <p>InkML is widely used in digital handwriting applications that rely on stylus input. 
    Note-taking programs, sketching apps, and digital whiteboards use InkML to store and process user-generated strokes. 
    By capturing detailed stroke data, these applications can replay handwriting, adjust its appearance, or convert it to text. 
    InkML makes it easier for software to understand the user’s writing style, which can improve accuracy in handwriting recognition. 
    For creative tools, it also helps preserve the natural motion and feel of drawing.</p>
    
    <p>The standard is also frequently used in electronic signature systems. 
    Banks, delivery companies, and legal services often rely on more than just the appearance of a signature; they also examine the way it was written. 
    InkML’s ability to store pressure and timing data makes signatures more secure because it captures characteristics that are difficult to forge. 
    This gives organizations a higher level of confidence when accepting digital signatures. 
    By preserving the motion behind the signature, not just the shape, InkML enhances digital security.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to consumer applications, InkML is valuable in technical and academic environments. 
    Educational tools may use InkML to capture handwritten math equations, diagrams, or annotations made during lessons. 
    Researchers studying handwriting recognition also use InkML data to train and test algorithms. 
    Design and modeling software can use InkML to capture precise stylus movements for more natural drawing experiences. 
    Across all of these fields, InkML provides the detailed and structured ink data needed to support advanced digital writing systems.</p>

    <pre><code>
&lt;ink xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2003/InkML"&gt;
  &lt;trace id="t1"&gt;
    100 100, 120 130, 140 160, 160 190
  &lt;/trace&gt;
